# AirBnb

Project Objective:
The project focuses on analyzing London AirBnB to predict the prices (for one day) of Airbnb based on their location, price range, guests experience (reviews) and other related features.

Background information:
Airbnb claims to be part of the "sharing economy" and disrupting the hotel industry. Guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world.

As Airbnb strives to be an end-to-end travel platform, it is increasingly important for people to share travel information that help in making travel decisions. In order to scale the ability to respond queries, people needed an approach to provide high quality information about objects (e.g. cities, landmarks, events, etc.) and the relationships between them (e.g. most popular landmark in a city with a reasonable price, best area for living, etc.).

This project aims to accomplish this by data preprocessing and using regression models. At the end, to achieve useful insights from the observations which was made during the analysis of the data.
